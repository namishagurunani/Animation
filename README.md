# Explanation:
# HTML Code:
- HTML5 structure with basic meta tags and a link to an external CSS file.
- Contains a <div> element with the class "container" to group multiple images.

# CSS Code:

- The universal selector (*) is used to reset margins, padding, and box-sizing for all elements.
- The body element is styled:
  Set to flex display to horizontally and vertically center its children.
  Background color set to black (#000).
  Minimum height of 100vh ensures it covers the viewport height.
- The .container class:
 Displayed as flex, making its children align horizontally.
  Width set to 1100, but it should have a unit like px or % (e.g., width: 1100px;).
  Uses -webkit-box-reflect to create a reflection effect below the container.
- The .container img class:
  Sets a maximum width of 350px for all images within the container.
  Applies a 3D transform effect with a perspective, giving images a 3D appearance.
  Adds a smooth transition effect of 0.5 seconds for transforms.
  Applies a box shadow and rounded corners to images.
- On hover, the .container:hover img class:
  Reduces the opacity of images to 0.3 when hovering over the container.
- Additionally, the .container img:hover class:
  Resets the transform to make images appear flat.
  Restores full opacity when an image is hovered.
